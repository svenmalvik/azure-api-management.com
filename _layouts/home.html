                        </header>
                        <p>
                            Traditional instructor-led workshops costs many thousands of dollars. 
                            Compared to pre-recorded workshops that we buy online for little money, 
                            we expect greater value. That's not always the fact, but the reality.
                            <br><br>
                            We took the best of both worlds, and combined them in one workshop. 
                            The result is an instructor-led workshop for 50€. 
                            You can still ask questions, interact with each other, 
                            or just listen to the instructor.

                        <p>For many people, it's more fun to learn in small groups. It's also easier to ask questions. 
                            The same is true for the instructor. The instructor will learn about your challenges in much more detail, 
                            and can give you better answers. This workshop has a limit of 5 participants.
                            In case you are team of more than 5 people drop me a message.

                        <p>
                            Azure API Management has many great features. 
                            Each week we will focus on one feature in more detail than on others. 
                            We will always cover the basics, so everyone in this workshop will be on the same page. 
                            In one workshop we might focus on Logging, in the next workshop we will investigate the Developer Portal.

                            Azure API Management is used as the front door towards your services that can run on 
                            Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Web Services and other places. This workshop will help 
                            you to understand Azure API Management, so you can deploy your APIs and secure your services.

                            I've worked with Azure API Management in production
                            for the last two years at Vipps AS. Vipps is the number one payments service in Norway, and also the 
                            most successful digital wallet in the world as almost the entire population of Norway is using our services. 
                            The way we interact with Azure API Management has impressed Microsoft  
                            so much that they invited us to Seattle and give a talk at Microsoft Build 2019.
                            What a great experience.
