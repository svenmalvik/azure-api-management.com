# 2 hours APIM Workshop

## Teaser
### Why APIM is important
### Cheaper than trditional cources
### Central role in from onprem to Azure
### Strong Connections to Microsoft and APIM

As technology evolves, and our technology stacks change, <br>we need a service that can tie all that together and provide one user friendly, consistent, and easy to maintain API for our clients.<br><br>
In this workshop you will learn how you can use Azure API Management to move your services from an on premise partner to Azure, and how you can use this service to make the clients of your APIs more engaged.<br><br>
This workshop is for developers, architects, and IT decision makers who want to understand the power of Azure API Management and learn how to master it.

## Topic
### Azure API Management?
Azure API Management acts as a front door towards your services no matter wether they run in Azure, on premise, or at another cloud provider. It makes sure that your clients have access to the right APIs in a user friendly way.
### Why APIM is important
As time goes by, technology evolves, and our technology stacks change, we need a layer that can tie all of our services together. It should not matter whether some of our services run on Azure Kubernetes Service, on a VM maintained by a partner, or if we have new serveless services running as Azure Functions. Azure API Management acts as a front door towards all of our services, and makes sure that only clients with proper access can send requests to the right services.
In this workshop, you will learn how you can use Azure API Management as a front door towards all of your services.
### What you can do with APIM
Moving an entire infrastructure from an on premise partner to Azure will take some time, and should be done in small, controlled and secure steps. Using Azure API Management is often one of the first services being used and that can help you to achieve this goal.
In this workshop you will learn how you can use Azure API Management to move your services from an on premise partner to Azure, and how you can use this service to make the clients of your APIs more engaged.
### How 100 developers work with one instance
Many companies emphasize nowadays having autonomous product teams over managing them from the top. Whenever I talk to theses companies about their challenges, one of the main concern is that they are running many instances of Azure API Management in production at the same time. Their challenges are not only about the overall costs that are skyrocketing, but also about the ability to create a consistent API that represents the company as a whole, and make the onboarding of clients easier.
In this workshop you will learn how to run one instance of Azure API Management in production, and still work independently from other product teams.
### Who should you use APIM
We can manage our services and APIs by simply using Nginx or any other proxy server. It's up to us to decide how much effort we put into a proxy to get what we want. Azure API Management is an easy to use gateway towards our services that let us manage our APIs directly from within an easy to use portal. Advanced management of APIs can be achieved by simply using one of the many SDKs that are provided.
This workshop is for developers, architects, and IT decision makers who want to understand the power of Azure API Management.

## Me
### Me from Germany
Hi, I'm Sven, your instructor for this workshop. I've worked with Azure API Management in production for the last two years at Vipps AS. Vipps is the number one payments service in Norway, and also the most successful digital wallet in the world as almost the entire population of Norway is using our services. The way we interact with Azure API Management has impressed the product team of Microsoft Azure API Management so much that they invited us to Seattle and give a talk together with them at Microsoft Build 2019 in front of 900 developers, architects, and IT decision makers. What a great experience! Since then, I have hold many workshops and talks at Meetups, large conferences, and many companies helping them to understand Azure API Management better.
### Why APIM matters to me
When I got in touch with Azure API Management two years ago it was really just a black box for me. People were talking about it all the time, and that they needed to deploy this API, create that product, and change those policies. It turned out that we had only one developer that really understood was he was talking about and who was maintaining everything related to it. I was not the only one seeing a black box. Some weeks later this developer started at a different company. Since this day, I started to learn everything about Azure API Management, and wrote a bunch of scripts that automated what's previously was manual tasks. I loved it, and my ambition is to show you why.

## Why this workshop is different
### Cheaper
Traditional instructor led-workshops, online or offsite costs many thousands of dollars each day. Compared to pre-recorded workshops that we buy online for under 100 dollar, we would expect to get many times more value for a instructor led workshop. Unfortunately, that's not always the fact. Very often, a pre-recorded workshop is as good or even better as an instructor led workshop.
I took the best of both worlds, and combined them in this workshop. The result is an instructor led workshop with only a few participants, and the price of an ordinary pre-recorded workshop. You can ask questions, interact with each other, or just listen to the instructors lessons. You decide together how the workshop will run.
### Small groups
For many people, it's more fun to learn in small groups. It's also easier to ask questions. The same is true for the instructor. The instructor will learn about your challenges in much more detail, and can give you better answers.
This workshop has a limit of 5 participants. In case you are product team of more than 5 just drop me a message and we will fix it.
### Every week another focus
Azure API Management is a service with many features. Instead of discussing all of them in one workshop, this workshop will focus on one feature more than on others. In this week we might focus on Logging. Next week we might focus on the Developer Portal. While we focus on different features each week, we will always cover some basics, so everyone is on the same page and understands what we are doing and why.
